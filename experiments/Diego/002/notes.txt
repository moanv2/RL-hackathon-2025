Goal: Adding more accuracy / precision metrics to bot_2

1. To encourage our agent to be more precise and have better accuracy since only shoots from the middle ray
2. Epoch == 50
3. Increased learning rate
4. Reduced gamma to favor immediate rewards
5. Reduced epsilon_decay so agent learns policy sooner
    3b. Linear (Epsilon - Decay rate)





all_rays = player_current_info.get("rays")
shot_fired = player_current_info.get("shot_fired")
middle_ray = all_rays[2]

# Detects player and gets reward / else punish slightly
ray_detection_type = middle_ray[-1]
if ray_detection_type == "player":
    reward += 1
    if shot_fired:
        reward += 1.5

        current_damage = player_current_info.get("damage_dealt", 0)
        previous_damage = player_previous_info.get("damage_dealt", 0)

        if current_damage > previous_damage:
            damage_diff = current_damage - previous_damage

            # same as above capping limit
            damage_diff = min(damage_diff, 20)

            reward += (current_damage - previous_damage) * 0.2  # reward for hitting
    else:
        reward -= 0.1

else:
    reward -= 0.01  # not aiming at player

    # Penalized if mf is randomly shooting (this aint o-block lil bro)
    if shot_fired:
        reward -= 0.3

return reward
